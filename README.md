# The is a WIP ETL library which takes input data and provides basic operations which can be performed

## The Idea is

1. Operations like filter, group, transform on data
2. Data can be defined based on schema
3. Error handling can be done as short circuit or collect the errors as values
4. No dependecies on any external library
5. Operations can be performed concurrently by using the users fav lib.
6. Choosing the effects must the the users choice
7. Adding new operations must be easy
8. Works only on inmemory data 
9. clean logging provision both on success and faliure operations
